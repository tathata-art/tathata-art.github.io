### Introduction

We use the term "artistic rehabilitation" as a simple activity to regain our abilities expressing thoughts and emotions via various types of medium. We write an article about visual/computer/interactive/installation art, craftsmanship ans culture. We make an artwork. We host an event for people to meet artistic experience.
